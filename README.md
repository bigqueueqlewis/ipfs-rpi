IPFS RPi
========

A bare bones [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) installer for the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

Log in to your Raspberry Pi with an administrator account (you can use the default `pi` user for this). From any local
directory, clone or download this repo, `cd` into it and run the installer:

```SHELL
$ ./install
```

**Notes**

* Do **not** execute the installation script with `sudo`
* You'll need root privileges to run the installer (the `pi` user does so by default)
* The IPFS user directory will be created at `~/.ipfs` (eg.: `/home/pi/.ipfs`)
* Go's version will default to 1.9 (latest version as of this writing)

### Tested on:

- [x] RPi 2

**Operating system**:
